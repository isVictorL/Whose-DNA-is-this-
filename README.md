The process of determining an individual's DNA characteristicsmedical is crucial for medical research. 
However, there are over 3 billion nitrogenous bases in a typical human genome, therefore comparing each person and every possible sequences will consume too mush computational power.
The good news is, we can compare the high diverse regions of the DNA to each person.
This C++ program helps user to identify who has the given DNA sequences, by comparing short sequences of DNA that repeats consecutively.
